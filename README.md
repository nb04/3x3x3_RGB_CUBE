Files included:
  3X3X3_RGB.fzz - Fritzing Diagram showing all connections and PCB routing
  3X3X3_RGB_PCB.zip - zip file including files for ordering PCBs online, I ordered my PCBs with JLCPCB (link: https://jlcpcb.com/)
  3x3 LED Template.stl - File for 3d printing a template to help with soldering the LEDs
  small_RGB_cube.ino - Arduino code

Materials list:
  1 Arduino Nano
  27 RBG LEDs (common cathode)
  2 SN74HC595 shift registers
  9 150 ohm resistors
  Female header pins for arduino
  2 16 pin IC sockets

Demonstration video: (coming soon)
