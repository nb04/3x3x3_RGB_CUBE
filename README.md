# 3x3x3_RGB_CUBE
Includes files for making a 3x3x3 RGB LED Cube using an Arduino Nano

Files included:
  \n\t 3X3X3_RGB.fzz - Fritzing Diagram showing all connections and PCB routing
  \n\t 3X3X3_RGB_PCB.zip - zip file including files for ordering PCBs online, I ordered my PCBs with JLCPCB (link: https://jlcpcb.com/)
  \n\t 3x3 LED Template.stl - File for 3d printing a template to help with soldering the LEDs
  \n\t small_RGB_cube.ino - Arduino code

Materials list:
  \n 1 Arduino Nano
  \n 27 RBG LEDs (common cathode)
  \n 2 SN74HC595 shift registers
  \n 9 150 ohm resistors
  \n Female header pins for arduino
  \n 2 16 pin IC sockets

Demonstration video: (coming soon)
